Assigment No: 5

Contribution:
I worked solo on this assignment by coding the programs as indicated by the website specifications.
My code from the previous assignment was modularity, so adding JQuery and Bootstrap was not difficult.
I modified the server file regserver.py by adding an additional endpoint that only returns the html for the courses, as requested by index.html which uses javascript and Jquery for that purpose.
Additionally, I deleted the submit button from index.html and made it responsive and nicer by using Bootstrap.
For regdetails.html, I deleted the another search link, and made it responsive and nicer with Boostrap.
Most of the remaining code was described in the readme for previous assignments.

External help:
I received no external help in this assignment.

Sources referenced:
In this assignment, I followed the course policies and guidelines for referencing external information. Moreover, I used the following sources:
- The first source helped me to figure out submitting the form after changing the text
https://www.javatpoint.com/jquery-change#:~:text=%E2%86%92%20%E2%86%90%20prev-,jQuery%20change(),boxes%20and%20elements.
- Most of the boostrap code had as a reference the PennyBoostrap application from this course
- Most of the jquery/ajax code had as a reference the PennyJQuery application from this course
- For Boostrap column layouts (used for displaying the course results), I used the following source:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/

Time spent in this assignment: 5 hours

My assessment:
This assignment helped me to apply my knowledge of Javascript, AJAX, and Boostrap for making web applications with consistent page states and responsiveness.
It has been really useful to practice these skills since I can apply them for my final project.
