Assigment No: 2

Contribution:
I worked solo on this assignment, by coding the programs as indicated by the website specifications.  I was able to code a modularized system that is divided into two sections, the client and server.

- Server:
I started by modularizing my previous code, and creating a database class in database.py, I also created functions for querying courses and classes, by creating the classes Course and ClassDetails for the objects, and the methods getClassDetails and getCourse for querying and formatting these requests. Finally in regserver.py, I coded the socket opening and closure in the main function, and wrote helper methods handleClient() and handleError(). The function handleClient() calls load to read a request from the client, which contains a command string and a list of arguments, calls the helper functions from other modules, and returns a success code and the requested object using dump. If the request resulted in an error, the program will raise an exception, which will be caught in the main function of regserver.py, which will call handleError(). This function will call dump to send an error code, and a customized error message.

- Client:
The client code is much simpler, and is divided into two. On one hand, reg.py contains all the user interface code in PyQt5, plus event handling. On the other hand, request.py contains the functions that interact with the server, by creating a socket, sending a request, reading a response, and closing the socket.

Combined, the server and client code make up a system that is modular and satisfies all the main and edge use cases described in the assignment page.

Time spent in this assignment: 12 hours

My assessment:
This assignment helped me to truly understand network programming and building a functional user interface. Although the PyQt5 section of this assignment was tedious, working through a lot of code helped me to better modularize our code and testing the system's components in isolation. I think this assignment fits this course well, and I would recommend keeping it for future semester.
